## Overview

The content in the this notebook is from https://github.com/yohman/OSM-workshop.

## Open Street Map

In this lab, you will learn how to:

-   use various python libraries to search for and download Open Street Map *building* data

-   categorize buildings by type

-   visualize buildings on a map

-   create a function to produce building maps

-   create a loop to produce building maps for multiple locations

Note that we will learn how to use street network analysis with OSMnx in subsequent labs.

Libraries we will use:

-   [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx)

-   [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

-   [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/)

-   [contextily](https://github.com/geopandas/contextily)

### Download visualizing Open Street Map data

### Import the libraries
```{python}
# to download osm data
import osmnx as ox

# to import and explore data
import pandas as pd

# to manipulate and visualize spatial data
import geopandas as gpd

# to provide basemaps 
import contextily as ctx
```
